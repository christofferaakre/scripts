# this script will take a .json term bank (frequency list) and
# use the frequency ratings to add stars to each term
# It should work by just placing it in the same directory as the
# termbank file and running it, but if you run into problems let me know
# at https://github.com/christofferaakre/scripts or email me at
# christoffer.corfield@gmail.com
# I will be happy to help!

# scripts
Some useful scripts I wrote. No license or anything, you can do whatever you
want with them.

## How to use
**Open the script in a text editor such as
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) and read the comments
before executing it**. Every script included here has extensive comments in the file
explaining what the script does and how to modify it to do what you need it to
without any technical knowledge required. I am **not** responsible if my script
fucks something up on your computer, but if that happens please let me know,
and I will be happy to do anything I can to help.
### `.ahk` scripts
You will need [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.

Just double click to run, they will run in the background.
All the scripts I posted have a hotkey to toggle them that you can
find by opening the file in a text editor such as
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) 
You can close the script from the system tray on Windows.

### .py scripts
You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
Open a command line or terminal in the directory you saved the script in,
then type `python scriptname.py` assuming the file is named `scriptname.py`.
The script will close when it is finished.
